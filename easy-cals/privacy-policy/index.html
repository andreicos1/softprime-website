          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>SOFTPRIME SOLUTIONS CONCEPT S.R.L. ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, process, and safeguard your information when you use the "Easy Cals" mobile application (the "App").</p>

          <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
          <p>SOFTPRIME SOLUTIONS CONCEPT S.R.L., a company registered in Romania, is the Data Controller responsible for your personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>

          <h2>3. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> When you sign in using Apple or Google authentication, we collect your email address, name, and an authentication token.</li>
            <li><strong>Health and Biometric Data:</strong> To calculate your daily macronutrient and caloric targets, we collect physical attributes such as height, weight, age, biological sex, activity level, and dietary goals.</li>
            <li><strong>Dietary and Usage Data:</strong> Information you log into the App, including food entries, meal descriptions, and custom nutritional data.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Basic server request logs including IP addresses and user-agent strings necessary for the operation and security of our servers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>Your data is used strictly for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Providing the core functionalities of the App (macro calculations and food tracking).</li>
            <li>Processing text or queries via third-party artificial intelligence to identify foods and estimate nutritional content.</li>
            <li>Authenticating your account and maintaining your session security.</li>
            <li>Sending account-related or technical support emails. We do not use your email address for marketing or promotional purposes.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Third-Party Data Sharing and Subprocessors</h2>
          <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share necessary data with the following third-party service providers solely to operate the App:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> Our backend systems and databases are hosted securely on Linode (Akamai). Your data is stored on their servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Providers:</strong> Apple and Google process your login credentials.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processor:</strong> All subscription payments are processed entirely by Apple. We do not collect, process, or store your credit card or billing information.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Providers:</strong> To analyze food inputs, meal descriptions are sent to third-party AI services via OpenRouter (including models from OpenAI and Google). <strong>Note:</strong> We do not send your name, email, or account identifiers to these AI models. Only the specific food query or prompt is transmitted.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Databases:</strong> Anonymous queries are made to the USDA FoodData Central (FDC) and Open Food Facts to retrieve nutritional data.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as your account is active.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You can delete your account and all associated data at any time directly within the App's settings menu.</li>
            <li>Upon requesting account deletion, your biometric data, dietary logs, and account identifiers are permanently removed from our active Linode database.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Your Rights (GDPR)</h2>
          <p>As a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), or under applicable global privacy laws, you have the right to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate personal data.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data ("Right to be Forgotten").</li>
            <li>Object to or restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request the transfer of your personal data to another party (Data Portability).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at the email address provided below.</p>

          <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>Because we utilize third-party APIs (such as OpenRouter for AI processing), the non-identifiable prompt data you input may be processed on servers located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the United States. We rely on legally approved transfer mechanisms, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure your data remains protected.</p>

          <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>The App is restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a minor, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our servers.</p>

          <h2>10. Security</h2>
          <p>We implement industry-standard security measures, including encrypting all data in transit using HTTPS and securing our backend server infrastructure, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.</p>

          <h2>11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.</p>
